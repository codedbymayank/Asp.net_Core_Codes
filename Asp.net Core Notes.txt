Lecture - ( What's Asp.net Core ) 

What's dotnet core ?
-> dotnet core is an opensource and cross platform framework which is used for building serveral types of application
-> with the help of it we can develop web applications , desktop , gaming apps etc .
-> It also have CLI support 
-> For package management we use nuget package manager 
-> using cli :- dotnet new mvc --name someapp  [ mvc is template and it can be anything ]
-> to run using cli :- dotnet run

Lecture - ( What's MVC Pattern )
-> Model View Controller 
-> It's an architectural design pattern means this design pattern is used at the architectural level of an application
-> Model View Controller are the main components of mvc design pattern 

Role of model , view & controller 
-> model is responsible for data
-> view is responsible for ui
-> controller is responsible for the flow of application by accepting user input

Controller :-
-> A controller is .cs file which have some methods calls action methods
-> when a request comes to controller , at that time it actually hits a method 
-> Now everything depends on that method , whatever it will going to return 

Model :-
-> A model is asp.net core is simple class which have only some properties and those are autoimplemented 
-> model is just used to pass data from controller to view and viceversa

View :-
-> A view is a combination of html & C# 
-> Extension of view file is .cshtml
-> When a view is rendered on browser at that time c# code will also convert into html and because only html code is visible on browser 

Benefits Of MVC :-
-> Sepration of concern
-> Each component have its specific job , because of which debugging is get easy 

Note :- Asp.net core is a part of dotnet core framework . Dotnet core framework used in console app and asp.net core used for web app 


Lecture - ( Convert console into web app ) 
-> By default every web application is a console application in dotnet core 
-> When we add some features into a console app , then it turns into web application
-> After installing dotnet core framework , at that time asp.net core framework will automatically installed 

Steps to convert console app into web app :-
-> update sdk in .csproj file ( for opening csproj just edit project file )
-> update output type in .csproj file
-> Add new webhostbuilder ( Webhostbuilder will convert any console app into web app )
-> Add routing for http calls
-> setup default route 

What is Host ?
-> It's an object which encapsulate the resource of an application like dependency injection , logging , configuration

Note :- In asp.net framework we have to use third party tool for DI , but in dotnet core it's inbuilt because of hostbuilder
